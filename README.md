## üìà  [Sales forecast with Time Series](https://github.com/natan-matos/sales-prediction)

In this project I made the sales forecast for 1115 pharmacys stores in europe. With the focus in a specific time, the predictions are made for 6 weeks in the future. The aim is to give to the CEO a complete view of the stores, to make the best decisions.

The final result was a Telegram bot, feed by an API, where you can access sales forecast for all stores using only the store code.

## üìí [Ranking clients in a health insurance company | Projeto em progresso ](https://github.com/natan-matos/health-insurance)
Uma Seguradora de ve√≠culos criou um novo produto, um Seguro de Sa√∫de, e deseja oferecer para sua base j√° existente de clientes. Uma pequena amostra da base foi usada para fazer a primeira oferta e coletar dados de interesse dos clientes nesta campanha de Cross-sell.

Como a base de clientes √© muito grande, e a empresa possui multiplos canais de comunica√ß√£o, encontrar a forma mais efetiva de contactar os clientes pode se traduzir em uma enorme enconomia nas campanhas de comunica√ß√£o. Construir um modelo para prever se um cliente estaria interessado em Seguro de Sa√∫de √© extremamente √∫til para a empresa, pois ela pode planejar sua estrat√©gia de comunica√ß√£o para alcan√ßar esses clientes e otimizar seu modelo de neg√≥cios e receita.

My main goal is to work as a Data Scientist, developing data products, either through Analysis and Machine Learning or Statistics techniques to solve business problems for companies.

As a Data Scientist my last job was to develop a buy propensity score to sort a list of customers and prioritize business team calls, using Learning to Rank algorithms and Python programming language. According to estimates, this solution would bring a monthly increase of 15% in the company‚Äôs revenues. The solution was developed with public data and demonstrated in a portfolio of personal projects that you can check out in the projects section below in this profile.
